# SimpleAutomation

Used a simple java main method to automate a trading account creation in ii website. The script opens https://www.ii.co.uk/account-opening/trading-account in chrome browser and enters the basic details of a client.

Along with java, selenium webdriver 4.1.0 is used to replicate the browser behaviour. The script was created using Intellij IDE

The elements of the page was located using Id and CSS locators.

Improvements:
1. test script can be made to run in different browsers
2. many OOPS concepts like inheritance, object and classes could be used

Steps to run the test
1. clone this repository
2. Right click main class and select Run 'Main'
